# POE-data  

This is a work in progress project that I'm currently exploring. The goal is to collect data and dive into TensorFlow by building a simple neural network based that evaluates in-game items that players frequently sell to each other. Items are evaluated based on unique "features" that modify their effectiveness in certain situations. The goal of the neural network is to estimate what a player might list an item for on the public market.
